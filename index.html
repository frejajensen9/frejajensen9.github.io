      <img src="Images/freja.jpg" style="width: 100px; float: right; margin-left: 15px;" alt="Freja">    <p>Hello! My name is Freja, and I’m 24 years old. I’m from Copenhagen, Denmark, and recently moved to Hong Kong for
      a semester as part of finishing my master’s in Computer Science. In my spare time, I’m a big fan of sports,
      especially volleyball and running, and I enjoy spending time with my friends and family.<br /><br />
      I chose to participate in <b>COMP4461</b> this semester because I’m very interested in the topic of developing
      technology based on human needs. I want to understand humans better in order to create better software solutions
      that actually solve real problems and fulfill the needs of users. I have created <b>‘COMP4461 Projects’</b>page
      on this website, which serves as a diary of the processes and personal reflections.

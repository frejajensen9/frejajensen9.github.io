        <h3><b>Project 2</b> “Make the campus more friendly for visiting students from the animal kingdom”</h3>

        <h5><b>1. Description of the project and your goal</b></h5>
        <p>Our goal was to identify a market with the need for a voice/chatbot.
            We came up with the idea to implement a voice/chatbot bot that would
            be able to answer questions from foreigners about how paying works in
            a specific country and how to set up e-payment solutions if available.
            Airports in different countries should have a fixed computer with our
            system installed, where foreigners then can ask any questions to the
            bot in order to achieve being able to pay somehow in the given country.
            The idea is to eliminate the risk of foreigners feeling uncomfortable
            in a country, not knowing how payment works and maybe also not capable
            of communicating with any locals because of different languages. </p>
        <h5><b>2. Learning and execution process</b></h5>
        <p>First phase involved brainstorming what different areas could potentially
            benefit from a voice/chatbot. The ideas we came up with can be seen in Figure 1.</p>
